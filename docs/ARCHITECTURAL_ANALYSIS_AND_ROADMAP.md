**Date:** November 2026
**Baseline Status:** v0.1.7, stable master commit `c00809c`, 100% Green CI/CD
**Target Platform:** Termux on Android 16+ for aarch64 & Rootless Linux Environments for x86_64 & aarch64
**Related Documents:** `research/INTERNAL_CAPABILITY_TESTS_RUN2.md`, `research/DOCKER_RUNTIME_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/src/migration-guide.md`

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Status Quo

### 1.1 Validated Foundations
PDN has evolved from an exploratory Rust port into a production-grade container management and service orchestration platform:
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Integrity**: 15 GitHub Actions workflow jobs are **100% GREEN**. These jobs are Host Build, 133 Unit/Integration Tests, Cross-Compile Matrix for aarch64 and x86_64, Docs mdBook, Fuzzing, and Security Audit. The cross-compile matrix covers NDK r27c and r30.
2. **Defect Remediation & Security Hardening**:
   - *Child Process Exit Code*: PDN forwards child exit codes accurately through `proot_core::ChildExit` downcasting. Exit statuses 0..127 pass directly and do not collapse to 1.
   - *Guest Path Traversal*: PDN closed a traversal vulnerability in `copy` subcommands. The fix uses strict token validation, rejection of `..`, and canonical rootfs boundary enforcement.
   - *SELinux Hardlink Safe Unpacking*: Automated fallback to file copies when `hard_link` is denied by Android SELinux policies during OCI layer extraction.
   - *Shared Memory `/dev/shm` 1777*: Standalone POSIX shared memory store. This store enables Chromium Headless and Playwright DOM extraction without crashes.
   - *Environment Variable Sanitization*: Clean guest environment isolation. PDN passes only 6 essential variables. This step eliminates the leakage of 163 host Termux variables.
   - *Dynamic Distribution Identification*: Real-time distribution identification parsed from guest `/etc/os-release` or `/usr/lib/os-release` for accurate `podnext list` reporting.
3. **Full Parity with proot-distro**:
   - `install`, `login`, `run`, `list`, `remove`, `rename`, `copy`, `sync`, `reset`, `search`, and `info`. The `sync` command uses sha256 and the `--delete` flag.

### 1.2 Fundamental Android Kernel Constraints as Empirical Ground Truth
In-depth empirical testing documented in `research/INTERNAL_CAPABILITY_TESTS_RUN2.md` confirms the hard boundaries of pure PRoot on Android:
- Android Bionic's seccomp filter intercepts `mount(2)` and terminates it with the `SIGSYS` signal. `SIGSYS` is signal 31.
- `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` returns `EINVAL`. Google's Android GKI kernel disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.
- `unshare(CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWNET)` returns `EPERM` because of unprivileged process capabilities. The effective capability set is `CapEff=0`.
- `/sys/fs/cgroup` is mounted read-only for unprivileged Termux users.

**Logical Deduction:** A genuine Docker daemon, `dockerd`, cannot run directly inside pure PRoot without a real Linux kernel. The required architectural solution is **Runtime Backend Modularization**.

---

## 2. Forensic Source Code Comparative Mapping: PRoot C Engine & PRoot-distro v5.10.3

PDN's architectural blueprint must be complete and executable in a single pass, also called single-pass execution. For this reason, forensic code audits were performed directly on the upstream PRoot C codebase at `source/proot-src`. The audits also covered the Termux `proot_distro` Python framework v5.10.3.

### 2.1 Anatomy & Internal Mechanics of the PRoot C Engine (`proot-src`)

| PRoot C Module | Source File | Internal Logic & Operational Mechanics | Architectural Implication for PDN |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ptrace Event Loop & Signals** | `src/tracee/event.c`, `src/ptrace/wait.c` | PRoot installs `SIG_IGN` for almost all signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`). Only select signals (`SIGQUIT`, `SIGSEGV`, `SIGABRT`) trigger `kill_all_tracees2()`. PRoot does not set `PTRACE_O_EXITKILL`. | **Root Cause of Zombie Processes**: Sending `kill -9` to PRoot leaves guest tracee processes orphaned and reparented to init. Controlled teardown requires signal escalation: sending `SIGQUIT` first to let PRoot terminate its children cleanly. |
| **VFS Syscall Interception** | `src/syscall/enter.c`, `src/syscall/exit.c` | `enter.c` (94KB) intercepts path-based syscalls (`openat`, `stat`, `execve`, `chdir`) and translates guest absolute paths to host rootfs paths. `exit.c` (23KB) patches return values (`uid=0`, `gid=0`, symlink sizes, and simulated mountinfo). | PDN Rust (`proot-core`) must maintain exact register alignment (`orig_x0` / `x8` on aarch64) and manipulate tracee memory via `process_vm_readv/writev`. |
| **Link2Symlink Extension** | `src/extension/link2symlink/` | Bypasses Android SELinux restrictions that prohibit `link(2)` on `/data`. Hard links are replaced by intermediate files prefixed with `.proot.l2s.` or `.l2s.`, while `stat` syscalls are patched to simulate genuine link counts (`st_nlink > 1`) and identical inodes. | When a container is renamed or copied, l2s symlinks containing absolute paths to the old rootfs break unless rewritten in-place. |
| **In-Memory SysV IPC** | `src/extension/sysvipc/` | Simulates System V IPC tables (`shmget`, `semget`, `msgget`) entirely in user-space memory inside the PRoot supervisor process. | Required by legacy software and enterprise databases that rely on SysV IPC rather than POSIX shared memory. |
| **Ashmem / Memfd** | `src/extension/ashmem_memfd/` | Emulates `memfd_create` using `/dev/ashmem` or anonymous temporary files when running on older kernels without native `memfd_create` support. | Prevents browser engines and modern runtimes (V8/Chromium/Electron) from crashing on Android. |
| **Kernel Version Spoofing (`kompat`)** | `src/extension/kompat/` | Spoofs the kernel release string (`--kernel-release=\\Linux\\...`) so that GNU C Library (glibc) does not abort with `FATAL: kernel too old`. | Essential for maintaining compatibility with modern distributions (Ubuntu 24.04/Debian 13) on Android. |
| **Android Seccomp Filter** | `patches/proot/seccomp-android.patch` | Bypasses modern syscalls blocked by Android 16 Bionic seccomp filters: `arch_prctl`, `rseq`, `membarrier`, `process_vm_readv/writev`, `clone3`, `openat2`, `mlock/munlock`. | Guarantees reliability for Node.js, Rust stdlib, and Chromium running inside guest containers. |

### 2.2 Anatomy & Internal Mechanics of the PRoot-distro Framework (`proot_distro` Python v5.10.3)

| Python Module | Source File | Internal Logic & Operational Mechanics | Architectural Implication for PDN |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hardened Descriptor VFS** | `dirfd.py` (57KB) | Traverses filesystems using sequential `openat(2)` descriptors with `O_NOFOLLOW`. Protects against symlink swap attacks mounted by guest processes during host operations. Uses `O_NONBLOCK` on regular files (`open_regular_at`) to prevent hangs from malicious named pipes (FIFOs). Uses descriptor-pinned `_chmod_fd` because Linux `fchmodat` lacks `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`. | PDN must replace recursive path string manipulation with a Rust `DirFd` abstraction wrapping `nix::fcntl::openat`. |
| **Inheritable POSIX Lock Manager** | `locking.py` | Employs non-blocking POSIX `flock(2)` across two namespaces: `ContainerLock` (Shared for `login`/`run`/`backup`; Exclusive for `install`/`remove`/`reset`/`rename`/`copy`) and `BuildLock` (Exclusive per image-tag). Clears `O_CLOEXEC` before `execvpe()` so descriptors remain held across the container session lifecycle. | Prevents race conditions and corruption when concurrent operations target the same container rootfs. |
| **Session Registry & Process Teardown** | `session.py`, `commands/kill.py` | Active sessions are recorded at `$RUNTIME_DIR/sessions/<pid>.json`. Liveness is probed via shared non-blocking `flock` (if acquired, the session is dead and cleaned up). `kill` scans `/proc/*/fd` to match the session file inode, then executes phased escalation: `SIGQUIT` to PRoot (graceful tracee cleanup) followed by `SIGKILL` to remaining orphans. | Enables accurate `podnext ps` process monitoring and clean `podnext kill` execution without residual zombies. |
| **Dynamic Sysdata Generator** | `sysdata.py` | Dynamically generates `/proc/stat` aligned with online CPUs extracted from host `/proc/cpuinfo`. Synthesizes `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/version`, `/proc/uptime`, `/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid` (65534), `/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid`, and `/proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap`. | Eliminates crashes in `htop`, `top`, and Go runtimes caused by CPU topology mismatches on Android. |
| **Link2Symlink Tree Rewriter** | `l2s.py` | Scans and rewrites `.proot.l2s.` / `.l2s.` symlink targets in-place after container relocations (`rename`, `copy`, migration). Traversal is protected with signal blockers (`SIGINT`/`SIGQUIT`) to prevent half-rewritten states. | Preserves hard link integrity when containers are moved or cloned. |
| **OCI Dockerfile Builder & Layer Differ** | `commands/build.py`, `helpers/dockerfile.py`, `helpers/layer_diff.py`, `helpers/oci_writer.py` | Parses Dockerfile syntax (`FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ENV`), executes `RUN` directives in a temporary container sandbox, computes filesystem deltas with whiteout markers (`.wh.<file>`), and serializes standard OCI v1 manifests and tarballs. | Transforms PDN into a self-contained image builder that operates without a running Docker daemon. |

## 3. Maturity Gap Evaluation & Opportunities for PDN

A comparison of the current PDN crates `proot-core`, `proot-distro-core`, and `podnext` with the upstream implementations shows the following concrete development opportunities:

1. **Session Registry & Inode-Based Process Teardown in `session` & `kill`**:
   - *Current State*: PDN lacks a centralized per-PID session registry with inherited `flock(2)` descriptors.
   - *Risk*: Abrupt termination of `podnext run` can leave orphaned zombie processes in Termux.
2. **Hardened Descriptor VFS in `dirfd`**:
   - *Current State*: Some operations in `proot-distro-core` use standard `std::path::PathBuf` traversal.
   - *Risk*: Susceptibility to symlink race conditions or FIFO deadlocks when operating on untrusted container filesystems.
3. **Link2Symlink Tree Rewriting on Container Relocation in `l2s`**:
   - *Current State*: `podnext rename` and `podnext copy` relocate rootfs directories but do not update embedded `.proot.l2s.` symlinks.
   - *Risk*: Internal hard links become broken symlinks after a rename. This applies to links such as `/usr/bin/perl` or package manager links.
4. **Custom Image Building with `build`**:
   - *Current State*: PDN can pull and unpack images from Docker Hub, but lacks a native `podnext build` subcommand for local Dockerfiles.
5. **Dynamic Host CPU Topology Alignment in `sysdata`**:
   - *Current State*: Synthesized `/proc/stat` entries in `sysdata.rs` use static rows. They do not read offline CPU cores from `/proc/cpuinfo` dynamically.

## 4. Infrastructure Evolution

### 4.1 Dual-Runtime Backend with the `RuntimeBackend` Trait
PDN decouples execution backends via a polymorphic trait interface:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait RuntimeBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn create_container(&self, spec: &ContainerSpec) -> Result<String>;
    async fn start_container(&self, id: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn exec_process(&self, id: &str, exec_spec: &ExecSpec) -> Result<ChildProcess>;
    async fn stop_container(&self, id: &str, timeout_s: u32) -> Result<()>;
    async fn inspect_container(&self, id: &str) -> Result<ContainerInspection>;
}
```

1. **`ProotBackend`, Lightweight & Instant**:
   - Optimized for 80% of everyday workflows: Debian/Ubuntu/Alpine shells, compilers, Python/Node.js, Playwright, toolchain development.
   - Metrics: Cold-start 0.09s, zero virtualization memory overhead, direct native CPU instruction execution.
2. **`UmlBackend`, Kernel & Docker Full-Fidelity**:
   - Connects PDN to the User-Mode Linux daemon `uml4termuxd` via UNIX domain sockets.
   - Activated when users run `podnext docker` or launch containers requiring systemd, iptables, wireguard, overlayfs, and cgroup controllers.
   - Delivers real Linux kernel isolation and needs no Android root privileges.

### 4.2 Termux Packaging & Ecosystem Standardization in `termux-packages`
- **Binary Separation**: Clear separation between the `podnext` CLI client and the `podnext-daemon` service supervisor.
- **Termux Build Recipe**: Up-to-date `termux-package/recipe/build.sh` aligned with NDK r27c/r30 for submission to official Termux repositories.
- **Runit Service Scripts**: Standard service templates at `$PREFIX/var/service/podnextd`. These templates enable supervisor management with `sv up podnextd` and `sv down podnextd`.

### 4.3 Android Sleep Mitigation & Phantom Process Killer Protection
Android 12+ enforces a *Phantom Process Killer* that limits background child processes to 32, and it enforces aggressive Doze Mode:
- **Android WakeLock Engine**: Automated acquisition of `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` while supervised services run.
- **Foreground Service Integration**: Integration with Termux:API and Termux:Boot to maintain persistent notifications. This action prevents Android OOM termination.

---

## 5. Architectural Design

### 5.1 Decoupled Client-Daemon IPC Architecture
- **Thin Client**: The `podnext` binary translates CLI commands into structured RPC requests.
- **Robust Daemon `podnextd`**: Manages centralized state, lock coordination, cgroup limits, and network routing.
- **IPC Protocol**: UNIX Domain Sockets that use JSON-RPC 2.0 or D-Bus Wire Protocol at `$TMPDIR/podnext/podnextd.sock`, with automatic direct-execution fallback if the daemon is offline.

### 5.2 Event-Driven Reactive State Engine
- **State Store**: Replaces raw directory scanning with a robust embedded database engine. PDN stores the state in `sled` or `sqlite` at `$PN_DATA_DIR/state.db`.
- **Atomic State Transitions**: PDN records status changes through Write-Ahead Logging, also known as WAL. The log records the status sequence `Creating` -> `Installing` -> `Stopped` -> `Running` -> `Failed`. This log prevents orphaned state on ungraceful exits.
- **Event Broadcasting**: Tokio broadcast channels stream lifecycle events to the CLI, D-Bus monitors, and web dashboards in real time. The CLI command `podnext log follow` reads these events.

### 5.3 Container Runtime Interface CRI & OCI Compliance
- Finalizes `pn-next/src/runtime.rs`, the CRI gRPC layer built on `tonic`.
- Enables lightweight container orchestration, for example with `k3s` or edge agent runners. This design allows an Android Termux instance to serve as an edge computing node.

## 6. Granular Module & Helper Specifications for Single-Pass Execution

The following technical specifications define the modules required for unified implementation:

### 6.1 Module `proot-distro-core::session` & `podnext kill` / `podnext ps`
- **Purpose**: Centralized container session registry and reliable process tree termination.
- **Implementation**:
  1. *Data Format*: Structured `$RUNTIME_DIR/sessions/<pid>.json` files that store `container_name`, `pid`, `started_at`, `login_uid`, and `cmdline`.
  2. *Inherited Locking*: Acquire `flock(fd, LOCK_EX)` on the session file before the `execvpe` call to launch PRoot. Clear the `FD_CLOEXEC` flag.
  3. *Liveness Probing*: `podnext ps` attempts a non-blocking shared lock `flock(fd, LOCK_SH | LOCK_NB)` on each registry file. Success indicates that the session has terminated, so an unlink is safe. Refusal with `EWOULDBLOCK` confirms that the session is alive.
  4. *Teardown Engine `podnext kill <container> [--all]`*:
     - Inspect `/proc/[0-9]*/fd/*` symlinks to identify processes holding the session file inode.
     - Execute phased signal escalation:
       - Phase 1: Send `SIGQUIT` to the root PRoot PID. This action triggers the internal `kill_all_tracees2` handler.
       - Phase 2: Wait 500ms. Then verify whether guest processes remain.
       - Phase 3: Send `SIGTERM` followed by `SIGKILL` directly to any surviving orphaned tracees.

### 6.2 Module `proot-distro-core::dirfd`: Hardened Descriptor VFS
- **Purpose**: Prevent symlink race attacks and FIFO blocking during host-guest file operations.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Rust `DirFd(RawFd)` wrapper with automated cleanup via `Drop`.
  2. Core methods:
     - `open_dir_at(&self, name: &str) -> Result<DirFd>` with `O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC`.
     - `open_regular_at(&self, name: &str, flags: OFlag) -> Result<File>` with `O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK | O_CLOEXEC`, verifying `S_IFREG` via `fstat`.
     - `safe_chmod_at(&self, fd: RawFd, mode: u32) -> Result<()>` modifying permissions directly through open descriptors.
     - `atomic_write_at(&self, name: &str, content: &[u8]) -> Result<()>` writing to unique temporary inodes followed by `renameat(2)`.

### 6.3 Module `proot-distro-core::l2s`: Link2Symlink Tree Rewriter
- **Purpose**: Repair intermediate hard link symlinks when containers are renamed or relocated.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Function `rewrite_l2s_tree(rootfs: &Path, old_rootfs: &Path, new_rootfs: &Path) -> Result<usize>`.
  2. Recursive tree traversal:
     - Check symlink targets: if matching `.proot.l2s.` or `.l2s.` prefixed with `old_rootfs`, substitute with `new_rootfs`.
     - Use atomic link creation and replacement via `renameat`.
  3. Guard traversal with the signal blockers `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` to ensure atomic completion.
  4. Automatically invoked at the conclusion of `podnext rename` and `podnext copy`.

### 6.4 Module `podnext build` (Native Dockerfile Builder & OCI Layer Differ)
- **Purpose**: Enable building custom container images from Dockerfiles directly in Termux.
- **Implementation**:
  1. *Dockerfile Parser*: Supports `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, `ENV`, `WORKDIR`, `EXPOSE`, `ENTRYPOINT`, and `CMD`.
  2. *Build Execution Engine*:
     - Spawns a temporary container sandbox from the base `FROM` image.
     - Executes sequential `RUN` steps inside the isolated PRoot environment.
  3. *Layer Differ*:
     - Computes SHA-256 hashes of modified and newly created files.
     - Detects deleted files and injects standard OCI whiteout markers such as `.wh.<filename>`.
     - Archives delta layers into compressed `tar.gz` blobs.
  4. *OCI Serializer*: Generates standard OCI v1 manifests, image configuration JSON, and registers images with the local cache.

### 6.5 Module `proot-distro-core::sysdata`: Dynamic CPU Topology Generator
- **Purpose**: Prevent monitoring utilities such as `htop`, `top`, and Node.js from failing because of dynamic CPU core throttling on Android.
- **Implementation**:
  1. Reads host `/proc/cpuinfo` to detect currently online CPU cores.
  2. Synthesizes `/proc/stat` containing matching `cpu0`, `cpu1`, ... entries aligned with host USER_HZ.
  3. Generates realistic default values for `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/uptime`, `/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid`, and `/proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap`. The default `/proc/loadavg` value is `0.12 0.07 0.02 2/165 765`. The default `/proc/uptime` value is `124.08`. The default `/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid` value is `65534`.
  4. Stores synthetic files outside the guest rootfs at `$CONTAINER_DIR/sysdata/` and bind-mounts them read-only.

### 6.6 Module `proot-distro-core::locking`: Inheritable POSIX Lock Manager
- **Purpose**: Prevent data corruption caused by concurrent operations on container filesystems.
- **Implementation**:
  1. `ContainerLock` manages `$RUNTIME_DIR/locks/<container>.lock`:
     - `Shared`: for `login`, `run`, `backup`, and `copy` on the source.
     - `Exclusive`: for `install`, `remove`, `reset`, `rename`, and `copy` on the destination.
  2. `BuildLock` manages `$RUNTIME_DIR/locks/build/<image_tag>.lock`. This lock is always `Exclusive`.
  3. Re-entrancy tracking prevents deadlocks during nested operations. An example is a `reset` call that calls `install`.

### 6.7 Networking Module (Userspace Rootless TCP/IP & Dynamic DNS Helper)
- **Gvproxy / Slirp4netns Integration**:
  - Delivers complete user-space TCP/IP stack emulation.
  - Enables container port publishing with `podnext run -p 8080:80`. This needs no iptables rule and no host root privileges.
- **Adaptive Dynamic DNS Helper**:
  - Monitors network route changes as Android switches between Wi-Fi and mobile data.
  - Routes container `/etc/resolv.conf` to a local DNS forwarding resolver managed by `podnextd`.

### 6.8 Storage Module: OverlayFS Emulation & Layer Deduplication
- **OverlayFS Emulation / Reflink Deduplication**:
  - Leverages rootless `fuse-overlayfs` or symlink/hardlink tree branching to eliminate storage duplication across multiple containers sharing a common Debian base.
- **Garbage Collection & Prune Engine**:
  - Automated pruning of dangling image layers and unreferenced volumes. Use `podnext image prune` and `podnext volume prune`.

### 6.9 Supervisor, Watchdog & IPC Module
- **Adaptive Backoff & Flapping Detection**:
  - Enhances the circuit breaker. It detects rapid crash loops, also called flapping, and transitions services into a `Quarantine` state. This action stops CPU consumption from infinite restart loops.
- **Systemd Unit File Importer**:
  - Translates basic systemd `.service` unit files into native `podnext service` definitions.

---

## 7. Security Hardening

### 7.1 Zero-Trust Guest Boundary
- Adheres to verified security practices: **all data received from guest environments is untrusted**.
- The VFS layer intercepts symlinks that traverse outside the rootfs. Paths such as `/data/data/com.termux` and `/storage/emulated/0` are rejected unless an explicit `--bind` permits them.

### 7.2 Distro-Tailored Seccomp Profiling
- Prevents application crashes from blocked syscalls. The BPF filters return graceful `ENOSYS` or `EPERM` error codes for calls such as `sys_setxattr`, `keyctl`, or `bpf`.
