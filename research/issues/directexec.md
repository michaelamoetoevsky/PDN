## Summary

`podnext run <container> -- <cmd>` aborts when the **guest command itself** contains a `-r` or `--rootfs` token. The CLI scans the whole argv for those flags *before* it parses subcommands. It then concludes that the invocation is a direct-execution call.

## Reproduction

```sh
podnext run alpine -- rm -r /tmp/dummy
# Error: -r/--rootfs is required for direct execution mode
# exit 1
```

The same happens for any guest command containing `-r`, e.g. `rm -r`, `grep -r`, `tar -r`, or a path literally named `--rootfs`.

## Evidence: observed log

```
CRITICAL Syntax Hijack (`-r` inside guest command):
  Command: podnext run alpine -- rm -r /tmp/dummy
  Output:  Error: -r/--rootfs is required for direct execution mode (Exit 1).
  Root cause: main.rs:1407 checks raw_args.iter().any(|a| a == "-r" || a == "--rootfs")
  across entire argv before parsing subcommands or `--`. Any guest command containing
  `-r` aborts execution.
```

## Root cause

The early direct-execution pre-scan in `crates/podnext/src/main.rs` treated the mere presence of `-r`/`--rootfs` **anywhere** in argv as a direct-execution invocation. It ran before clap parsed anything. The CLI then misclassified a subcommand plus a `--`-separated guest command. It read the guest command's own flags as podnext's.

## Impact

- A large class of legitimate guest commands cannot run. This class includes anything that uses `-r`.
- The failure message points at podnext's own flag rather than the guest command, so the cause is not obvious to the user.

## Proposed fix

Only treat `-r`/`--rootfs` as direct-execution mode when it appears **before** any recognised subcommand and before the `--` separator. Anything after `--` belongs to the guest command and must be passed through untouched. Add a regression test for `run <container> -- rm -r <path>`.
